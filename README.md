# Object Detection with TensorFlow

This project uses TensorFlow and the Object Detection API to perform object detection in images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnanahad/object-detection-tensorflow.git
   cd object-detection-tensorflow

Description

This project utilizes a pre-trained deep neural network for object detection. The script takes an input image and outputs the detected objects along with confidence scores.

Results
The results of the object detection are visualized on the image, and a descriptive sentence is printed to the console.

Example

The image above shows the detection of objects with confidence scores.
